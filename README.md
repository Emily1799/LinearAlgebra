# LinearAlgebra - this is the first time I'm using Git

So, this is a (kind of) pointless project I've been working on to do stuff with matrixes. It was inspired by my (difficult!) Linear Algebra class. The class is over now, but I see this as a good opportunity to keep myself from forgetting everything I learned about Java, since most of my courses now are in C.

For now, it's mostly just defining ways of changing things in matrices, but I hope to slowly do real things, like row reducing, finding rank, calculating null and column space, etc. There's lots to do. I chose this project because I wanted to start working with a project that needed to be built up from the bottom, and Linear Algebra is perfect for that. Values lead to rows, lead to matrices, which have rank, which can be found with row reduction...

It's probably terrible. Enter at your own risk. Much googling of stackoverflow was done.
